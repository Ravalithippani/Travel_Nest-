        The Lotus Temple is a Bahá'í House of Worship located in New Delhi, India. It was completed in December 1986. Notable for its lotus-like shape,
         it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or 
         any other qualification. The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in clusters of three to 
         form nine sides,[1] with nine doors opening onto a central hall with a height of slightly over 34 metres[1] and a capacity of 1,300 people.
          The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards[3][4] and has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.
          The Lotus Temple is one of the most famous and most popular buildings in India. However it was only inaugurated in 1986. The temple lies south of New Delhi
           and has a unique and impressive design in the shape of a lotus flower, India's symbol for peace, purity, love and immortality.

        An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in 
        India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.
        The Taj Mahal is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River in a vast Mughal garden that encompasses nearly 17 hectares,
         in the Agra District in Uttar Pradesh. It was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal with construction starting in 1632 AD and
          completed in 1648 AD, with the mosque, the guest house and the main gateway on the south, the outer courtyard and its cloisters were
           added subsequently and completed in 1653 AD. The existence of several historical and Quaranic inscriptions in Arabic script have facilitated setting the chronology 
           of Taj Mahal. For its construction, masons, stone-cutters, inlayers, carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome builders and other artisans were requisitioned from the
            whole of the empire and also from the Central Asia and Iran. Ustad-Ahmad Lahori was the main architect of the Taj Mahal.

        The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and "victory tower" that forms part of the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs.It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India. It was mostly built between 1199 and 1220, contains 399 steps, and is one of the most visited tourist spots in the city. Qutab-ud-din Aibak initiated construction of the Qutub Minar, but only managed to finish the first level. His later rulers continued the construction, and in 1368, Firuz Shah Tughlaq rebuilt the top parts and added a cupola.

        It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.1190, which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.[9] The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns. The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" at the top of each stage.In general, minarets were slow to be used in India and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.
