        Lighthouse Beach is a hot favourite in the Kovalam area. You can climb to the top <br>
        of the lighthouse through a spiral staircase until you reach the very<br>
         summit. Here, all your exhaustion melts away as the first<br>
          breeze gently cradles your face. Couples flock here to take photographs that <br>
          adorn family albums for a lifetime. It is among the best vantage points to view the <br>
          coast line in Southern Kerala.
